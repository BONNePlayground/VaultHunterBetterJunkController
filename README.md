# Vault Hunters Better Junk Controller

Are you tired of finding accidentally placed items in the Junk Controller? Want to remove something, but it is impossible to find? Then maybe this mod is for you.

This mod implements 3 new functions in the Junk Controller:

* Sorting - a new button over the scroll bar location that allows to sort items by their registry name
* Search - a synchronization with JEI text area to show only items that contain searched text
* Drag and drop - you can now place items using Drag and Drop from JEI into the controller directly.

**NOTE:**
In VaultHunters Junk Controller operates on server side, so you need the mod to be on both: _CLIENT_ and _SERVER_ to operate.
